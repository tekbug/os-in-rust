# MANUALS

- This is a project that I have been wanting to do for a long time. I want to explore **Rust** and its capabilities.
- I don't know how long it will take me but the first two months were spent in teaching myself the basics and what to look for.
- It will be updated from time to time. And there is no reason other than learning more about the internals of computers and making myself better.

#### Enjoy.
